## Goals

The primary goal of KWasm is to be a relatively lightweight, embeddable, WebAssembly interpreter for applications 
running in the JVM (or on Android).  Beyond that, KWasm strives to:

* meet the latest current [WebAssembly Specification](https://webassembly.github.io/spec/core/index.html)'s requirements,
* use minimal system resources,
* maintain WebAssembly's strict sandbox-like functionality, and
* support interoperation between Java/Kotlin code and the WebAssembly it is tasked with running.

Achieving good performance is a goal as well, but as with all interpeters: performance will never be as good as a 
compiled solution.

The primary benefit of interpretation over compilation is the capability for dynamic module loading & execution.

## Milestones

The development of KWasm will be done in a series of milestones:

1. ✅ Implement text-based Wasm Parser Capability & AST-generation. (Completed 2020-01-01)
1. ✅ Use the text-based Wasm Parser to develop/test the interpretation of the AST. (Completed 2020-12-23)
1. ✅ Implement a binary wasm parser with AST-generation. (Completed 2021-01-07)
1. Get all [official spec tests](https://github.com/WebAssembly/spec/tree/master/test) to pass.
1. Finalize API.

## Recommended Development Environment Setup

Prerequisites:

* [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download) or [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html)

From the directory of your choice:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
1. Open IntelliJ/Android Studio, and Choose "New Project from Existing Sources"
1. Select the `KWasm` directory created in step 1.

That's it! The IDE will sync the project and you can begin working on KWasm.

### Running Tests

You can run the entire test suite with:

```bash
./gradlew test
```
